      <p>
        As part of a strategic outsourcing engagement, I had the unique opportunity to collaborate directly with a real estate investment analysis firm. My
        mission was to help them tackle a critical business challenge: <strong>digitizing their entire paper-based operational workflow</strong> to increase
        efficiency, reduce errors, and improve data accessibility.
      </p>

      <h3>Embracing a New Technology Landscape</h3>
      <p>
        This project was a fantastic learning experience as it introduced me to a tech stack that was different from our {`company's`} internal standard. I
        quickly adapted to and became proficient in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend:</strong> Building dynamic and stateful user interfaces with <strong>React</strong>, managing complex application state using{" "}
          <strong>Redux</strong>, and handling API communication with <strong>Axios</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend:</strong> Developing a robust and secure REST API using the <strong>Hapi.js</strong> framework for Node.js.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database:</strong> Working with a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> relational database, where I practiced disciplined development by writing{" "}
          <strong>migration scripts</strong> for every change to the database schema.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Integrating <strong>AWS S3</strong> for secure and scalable storage of documents and user-uploaded files.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A Purpose-Built Microservices Architecture</h3>
      <p>The system was intelligently designed with a microservices approach, consisting of two distinct applications that communicated with each other:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>An Internal Application:</strong> A feature-rich platform for company staff to manage investments, process documents, and oversee operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A Public-Facing Application:</strong> A streamlined and secure portal for external collaborators and partners to submit information and track
          progress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This dual-app structure ensured tailored user experiences while maintaining a secure separation between internal and external data.</p>

      <h3>Thriving in a Structured Agile Environment</h3>
      <p>
        This project solidified my experience working within a classic <strong>Agile/Scrum framework</strong>. Our workflow was built on a foundation of
        collaboration and transparency:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We used <strong>Jira</strong> to manage our sprints, tasks, and backlogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily stand-up meetings</strong> kept the team aligned and allowed us to address blockers quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sprint planning sessions</strong> ensured our goals were clear and achievable.
        </li>
        <li>
          A strict <strong>Pull Request (PR) workflow</strong>, where all code was reviewed by a team leader, guaranteed high code quality and knowledge
          sharing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        This engagement was a masterclass in adaptability. I not only mastered a new full-stack technology set but also demonstrated my ability to seamlessly
        integrate into a highly professional, process-driven development team. It proved my capacity to deliver value quickly in any environment, regardless of
        the specific tools or methodologies in use.
